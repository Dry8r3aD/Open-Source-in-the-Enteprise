The health and success of your company will now depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on the health and success of the open source project. Not only should you devote employee time to participation as community members (a topic covered in more detail in the section “Change Your Reward and Management Structure” on page 12), but your company can be a valuable resource. Your experiences with the software, including pull requests, bug fixes, and change requests, can help the community improve the code for everybody’s benefit.

이제 회사의 성공 여부는 오픈소스 프로젝트의 성공 여부에 달려있다고 볼 수 있습니다. 단순히 직원이 커뮤니티의 구성원으로써 활동하도록 하는 것 뿐만이 아니라 (이 주제는 12 페이지의 “Change Your Reward and Management Structure”에서 더 자세히 다뤄지고 있습니다), 회사 자체를 귀중한 자원으로 보는 것 입니다. 풀리퀘스트나 버그수정 등, 당신이 소프트웨어와 관련하여 한 경험들은 커뮤니티가 해당 오픈소스 프로젝트를 사용하는 모두의 이익을 위해서 코드를 개선시키는데 도움을 줄 수 있습니다.

Participation means doing the same things other contributors do. Developers working with the code can do the following:

* Post questions, ideas, and bug reports
* Contribute fixes and new features, signing the contributor agreements that give the project rights to the contributed code
* Attend code-a-thons and conferences, always being transparent about whom they work for
* Become committers (advanced developers who are trusted to change the core code repository) and participate in the project’s governance, as they grow into their community and leadership roles

여기서 "참여"라는 것은, 다른 기여자들이 하는 것을 똑같이 하는 것을 말합니다. 코드를 수정하는 개발자들은 아래와 같은 것들을 할 수 있습니다.

* 프로젝트에 대한 질문글 작성하기, 새로운 아이디어나 버그에 대해서 이슈 작성하기
* 수정사항과 신규기능을 개발하여 기여하고, 기여한 코드에 대한 권한을 프로젝트에 넘기는 기여자 계약에 서명하기
* 코더톤이나 컨퍼런스에 참가하고, 누구를 위해서 일하는지를 투명하게 밝히기
* 커미터(신뢰받는 숙련된 개발자들로써 저장소의 핵심 코드를 수정 할 수 있는 자)가 되어 커뮤니티와 리더십 역량을 키우며 프로젝트 관리에 참여하기

Their participation will help them gain recognition from the community of users and developers for both their own work and your company’s support.

이러한 참여 활동들은, 개발자는 자신의 작업 결과물과 회사로부터 받은 지원을 커뮤니티의 프로젝트 사용자들과 개발자들로부터 인정을 받을 수 있도록 도와줍니다.

Many successful projects in free and open source software follow community principles commonly known as the [Apache Way](http://apache.org/foundation/governance/). Although members of these projects might not use exactly the same terms as defined by leaders of the Apache Software Foundation, the principles are recognizable in the projects’ day-to-day conduct.

성공한 수많은 자유 소프트웨어 및 오픈소스 소프트웨어 중 대부분은 흔히 [Apache Way](http://apache.org/foundation/governance/)라고 불리는 원칙들을 따르고 있습니다. 비록 이런 소프트웨어 프로젝트들의 구성원들이 아파치 소프트웨어 재단의 리더들이 정의한 것과 완벽하게 동일한 단어를 사용하지 않을 수는 있지만, 프로젝트의 일상적인 행위에서 이 원칙들이 사용된다는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.

Developers will come to your company with these values or will learn them as they work on open source projects. What’s really difficult for the company is that similar values—tempered by the need for confidentiality in certain areas, which every organization experiences—must percolate from the developers through the entire organization. Advocates for open source work need to schedule discus‐ sions with management and get their buy-in on the culture needed to reap the benefits of open source. The value of transparency and community participation must be accepted at all levels of the company by managers, giving developers the freedom to determine where best to invest their efforts.

Here are some of the activities developers need to do when joining an open source community:

* Check the code of conduct and contributor agreements, which are important to adhere to
* Become adept at the tools used by the project
* Review the project’s documentation (which varies in comprehensiveness and completeness), starting with the README file
* Become comfortable with the process for making contributions provided by the project
* Ask questions and become familiar with other contributors through partici‐ pation in mailing lists or groups
* Start taking items to work on from the project’s TODO list
* Submit bug fixes

아래의 목록은 개발자가 오픈소스 커뮤니티에 참여하기 위해서 할 수 있는 활동들입니다.

* 활동하며 반드시 준수해야 할 행동강령과 기여자 계약을 확인하기
* 프로젝트에서 사용되는 도구들에 대해서 익숙해지기
* README 파일을 시작으로 프로젝트의 (프로젝트에 따라 완성도와 범위가 다양한)문서들 검토하기 
* 프로젝트에서 정해져있는 기여를 하는 절차를 숙지하가
* 질문을 하고, 메일링 리스트나 그룹을 통해서 다른 기여자들과 익숙해지기
* 프로젝트의 할 일 목록에서 일거리를 찾아 가져오기
* 버그 수정 제출하기

After your employees gain an understanding of the open source code, your orga‐ nization might find reasons to make your own changes. Often, a project will not have the exact features that you want. You might also decide to make different performance trade-offs. Open source projects encourage users to send all of their changes back “upstream” to the project repository. Depending on the license and how you plan to use the code, you might be required to do so. Well-designed projects are modularized so that people who want your changes can adopt them and others can ignore them.

It can take a long time—even years—to get your changes into the main project, or core. The project leaders might hold off for many reasons: they might decide that no one else needs your enhancements, or be afraid that they’re buggy, or worry that they’ll have a negative effect on performance. You also can run aground over cultural barriers: your developers simply might not understand the community well enough to gain its attention and trust. But it’s worth addressing any concerns the project leaders have and persist in trying to work together with them, not on your own.

You might need to set up a separate branch for development or clone the code and take it internal to your organization. This is called a fork. There are usually ways to reintegrate your fork with the main branch later, if the core committers agree to that.

When you contribute or push your fixes back, you get the enormous benefit of a thorough and uncompromising code review. The code that ultimately goes in will end up much better than the code you submitted: fewer bugs, better perfor‐ mance, and an architecture that is more generalized for future uses.

Furthermore, if your code becomes part of the core, you can simply install any updates that come from the project, secure in the knowledge that they have your enhancements and will work with them. If you fork the code, you must either give up getting new versions (and suffer from any security flaws and bugs the original code contained) or tediously reapply your enhancements to the new ver‐ sion, testing carefully and checking for changes that invalidate your own work.

The cost of maintaining forks is quite high over time, and most companies that lack the training to contribute back to the original project also lack the internal processes that would allow them to benefit from the original project’s continued development. They don’t download and incorporate upstream bug fixes, security patches, and feature improvements because the effort of coordinating with the original project increases as the original and custom versions diverge.

All that said, you might find that the changes you make to code have no prospect of being accepted into the core. Or, you might have reasons for withholding your changes; for instance, if you need to bury secrets in the code for regulatory or competitive reasons. Some companies choose to maintain a separate branch, publicly or privately, and do the grunt work of reapplying enhancements to new versions. Sometimes, companies contribute part of their changes back but with‐ hold others. Any withholding, however, can reduce the value and appeal of the project.
