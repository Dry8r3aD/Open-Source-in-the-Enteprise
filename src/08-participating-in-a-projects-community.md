The health and success of your company will now depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on the health and success of the open source project. Not only should you devote employee time to participation as community members (a topic covered in more detail in the section “Change Your Reward and Management Structure” on page 12), but your company can be a valuable resource. Your experiences with the software, including pull requests, bug fixes, and change requests, can help the community improve the code for everybody’s benefit.

Participation means doing the same things other contributors do. Developers working with the code can do the following:

* Post questions, ideas, and bug reports
* Contribute fixes and new features, signing the contributor agreements that give the project rights to the contributed code
* Attend code-a-thons and conferences, always being transparent about whom they work for
* Become committers (advanced developers who are trusted to change the core code repository) and participate in the project’s governance, as they grow into their community and leadership roles

여기서 참여한다는 의민는, 다른 기여자들이 하는 것을 똑같이 하는 것을 말합니다. 코드를 수정하는 개발자들은 아래와 같은 것들을 할 수 있습니다.

* 프로젝트에 대한 질문글 작성하기, 새로운 아이디어나 버그에 대해서 이슈 작성하기
* 수정사항과 신규기능을 개발하여 기여하고, signing the contributor agreements that give the project rights to the contributed code
* Attend code-a-thons and conferences, always being transparent about whom they work for
* 커미터(신뢰받는 숙련된 개발자들로써 저장소의 핵심 코드를 수정 할 수 있는 자)가 되어 프로젝트 관리에 참여하기, as they grow into their community and leadership roles

Their participation will help them gain recognition from the community of users and developers for both their own work and your company’s support.


Many successful projects in free and open source software follow community principles commonly known as the Apache Way. Although members of these projects might not use exactly the same terms as defined by leaders of the Apache Software Foundation, the principles are recognizable in the projects’ day-to-day conduct.

Developers will come to your company with these values or will learn them as they work on open source projects. What’s really difficult for the company is that similar values—tempered by the need for confidentiality in certain areas, which every organization experiences—must percolate from the developers through the entire organization. Advocates for open source work need to schedule discus‐ sions with management and get their buy-in on the culture needed to reap the benefits of open source. The value of transparency and community participation must be accepted at all levels of the company by managers, giving developers the freedom to determine where best to invest their efforts.

Here are some of the activities developers need to do when joining an open source community:

* Check the code of conduct and contributor agreements, which are important to adhere to
* Become adept at the tools used by the project
* Review the project’s documentation (which varies in comprehensiveness and completeness), starting with the README file
* Become comfortable with the process for making contributions provided by the project
* Ask questions and become familiar with other contributors through partici‐ pation in mailing lists or groups
* Start taking items to work on from the project’s TODO list
* Submit bug fixes

After your employees gain an understanding of the open source code, your orga‐ nization might find reasons to make your own changes. Often, a project will not have the exact features that you want. You might also decide to make different performance trade-offs. Open source projects encourage users to send all of their changes back “upstream” to the project repository. Depending on the license and how you plan to use the code, you might be required to do so. Well-designed projects are modularized so that people who want your changes can adopt them and others can ignore them.

It can take a long time—even years—to get your changes into the main project, or core. The project leaders might hold off for many reasons: they might decide that no one else needs your enhancements, or be afraid that they’re buggy, or worry that they’ll have a negative effect on performance. You also can run aground over cultural barriers: your developers simply might not understand the community well enough to gain its attention and trust. But it’s worth addressing any concerns the project leaders have and persist in trying to work together with them, not on your own.

You might need to set up a separate branch for development or clone the code and take it internal to your organization. This is called a fork. There are usually ways to reintegrate your fork with the main branch later, if the core committers agree to that.

When you contribute or push your fixes back, you get the enormous benefit of a thorough and uncompromising code review. The code that ultimately goes in will end up much better than the code you submitted: fewer bugs, better perfor‐ mance, and an architecture that is more generalized for future uses.

Furthermore, if your code becomes part of the core, you can simply install any updates that come from the project, secure in the knowledge that they have your enhancements and will work with them. If you fork the code, you must either give up getting new versions (and suffer from any security flaws and bugs the original code contained) or tediously reapply your enhancements to the new ver‐ sion, testing carefully and checking for changes that invalidate your own work.

The cost of maintaining forks is quite high over time, and most companies that lack the training to contribute back to the original project also lack the internal processes that would allow them to benefit from the original project’s continued development. They don’t download and incorporate upstream bug fixes, security patches, and feature improvements because the effort of coordinating with the original project increases as the original and custom versions diverge.

All that said, you might find that the changes you make to code have no prospect of being accepted into the core. Or, you might have reasons for withholding your changes; for instance, if you need to bury secrets in the code for regulatory or competitive reasons. Some companies choose to maintain a separate branch, publicly or privately, and do the grunt work of reapplying enhancements to new versions. Sometimes, companies contribute part of their changes back but with‐ hold others. Any withholding, however, can reduce the value and appeal of the project.
